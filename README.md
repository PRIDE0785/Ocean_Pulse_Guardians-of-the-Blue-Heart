Ocean Pulse – Guardians of the Blue Heart

Mission

To translate NASA’s vast and complex stream of Earth science data into a clear, accessible, and dynamic heartbeat of our planet’s oceans.

Problem

The world’s oceans are facing serious threats from climate change, pollution, and rising temperatures. Although NASA collects extensive data on sea surface temperature, chlorophyll levels, and sea level rise, this information often remains technical and inaccessible to the general public, educators, and policymakers.

Our Solution – Ocean Pulse
Ocean Pulse is an interactive web platform that visualizes real NASA ocean data from satellites such as Aqua, Terra, and Sentinel-6. It transforms scientific datasets into engaging and educational visual dashboards, showing the ocean’s real-time pulse and helping users understand and explore changes in ocean health.
